This script allows you to view more in detail: Network information, Installed programs, Installed drivers and running tasks.
This is not a completed project however works with what I coded in it.
The program is a bit slow so if you choose to view Installed Programs expect to wait a few seconds.
Note: do not choose 6-8 that would crash the script.

This was coded and tested on Windows 10 Pro edition.
